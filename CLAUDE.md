# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install all dependencies (root, backend, frontend) using pnpm
pnpm run install:all

# OR install manually
pnpm install
cd backend && pnpm install  
cd ../frontend && pnpm install

# Create backend environment file
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL, Redis URL, and Google Gemini API key
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Recommendation

**For the best development and user experience, use Scenario Mode:**
1. Start the application: `pnpm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001
3. Click "Âú∫ÊôØÊ®°Âºè" (Scenario Mode) in the top navigation
4. Upload an image and explore pre-configured processing scenarios
5. Experience one-click professional image enhancement

Scenario Mode provides the most streamlined user experience with intelligent AI model selection and pre-optimized processing workflows.

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start both backend and frontend in development mode
pnpm run dev

# Start individual services
pnpm run dev:backend    # Backend only (port 3005)
pnpm run dev:frontend   # Frontend only (port 3000)
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run database migrations (requires RUN_MIGRATIONS=true in .env)
cd backend
pnpm run dev  # Migrations run automatically on server start

# Note: New migration 002_enhance_jobs_table.sql adds enhanced job tracking
# Note: Migration 003_api_configurations.sql adds API configuration management
# Note: Migration 004_fix_jobs_table_consistency.sql fixes PostgreSQL type consistency issues
```

# Build entire project
pnpm run build

# Build individual services
pnpm run build:backend
pnpm run build:frontend

# Run tests
pnpm test                    # All tests
pnpm run test:backend       # Backend Jest tests
pnpm run test:frontend      # Frontend Vitest tests
cd frontend && pnpm run test:watch  # Watch mode for frontend tests

**Common Development Issues & Solutions:**

**Scenario Mode Result Display:**
- Issue: Generated images not displaying after processing completion
- Root Cause: Field name mismatch - backend sends `result_variants`, frontend looks for `variants`
- **Solution**: Updated ScenarioImageEditor to use `result_variants` field consistently
- **Fixed**: Implemented simplified polling mechanism like ImageEditor for reliability

**Frontend UI Styling (Scenario Mode):**
- Issue: Feature buttons appearing white/invisible on dark background
- Root Cause: CSS conflicts between `bg-gray-50` and dark theme
- **Solution**: Updated compact feature buttons to use `bg-white/10` with proper contrast
- **Fixed**: All scenario buttons now have proper visibility and hover effects

**PostgreSQL Type Consistency:**
- Issue: `inconsistent types deduced for parameter` errors in job status updates
- Solution: Migration 004 ensures proper VARCHAR/TEXT type handling
- Prevention: Always validate SQL parameter types match database schema

**String Escape Issues:**
- Issue: `Expecting Unicode escape sequence \uXXXX` in React components
- Solution: Replace `\"` with `"` in JSX string attributes
- Prevention: Use consistent quote escaping in template literals

**API Configuration Issues:**
- Issue: Initial setup fails with UUID format errors
- Solution: Ensure proper UUID format in database queries
- Prevention: Validate UUIDs before database operations

**Data Type Compatibility:**
- Issue: VariantGallery expects both `thumb_path` and `image_url` fields
- **Solution**: Enhanced VariantModel.findByJobId to JOIN with images table and provide image_url
- **Result**: Unified data structure supporting both legacy and new display patterns

**Development Workflow:**
1. Run `pnpm run install:all` after git pull
2. Check `.env` file exists and has required variables
3. Start backend first: `pnpm run dev:backend`
4. Start frontend: `pnpm run dev:frontend`
5. Access application at http://localhost:3001 (frontend) with backend at http://localhost:3005
6. **Recommended**: Use Scenario Mode for best user experience and testing
